				</header>
				<h3>CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION</h3>
				<p>Since the beginning, our team chose to work with expats as the target audience because we wanted
					to
					connect our idea for the brand with people with similar needs and wants. As expats are people
					who
					move to a new country other than their own for work or education, we decided to work with them
					and
					hopefully be able to reach more by spreading our brand. After the solution interviews, we
					noticed we
					needed to be narrower with the target group. Therefore, we decided to narrow the segment, from
					18 to
					27, to 18 to 24, and we reached people at that age. We noticed they needed help with the same
					things
					we offered: service, documentation, legalization, and translation. Our main idea for the brand
					was
					to help them with their needs and wants, so we focused on these needs and created a safe and
					friendly environment for all of them.
				</p>
				<h5>Validation</h5>
				<p>
					At the end of the project, we kept the target group of expats, where we focused on the
					age gap from 18 to 24 as a conclusion from all the interviews and the survey we made. Most of
					the
					people we interviewed were between this age, and all of them had a side job, so we concluded we
					wanted our target audience to consist of expats who work and study. At the same time, we
					expanded
					the audience with the services we were offering through the channels we decided to use at the
					end.
				</p>
				<h3>VALUE PROPOSITION</h3>
				<p>After creating the first value proposition and having the solution interviews later on, we needed
					help inventing a new, better version of the current one. We wanted to make a unique value
					proposition that could connect to the people we wanted to reach. We had a couple of different
					versions, but they needed to touch our audience more than we were willing. However, after
					gathering
					all the solution interviews, our team made a meeting. Next, we examined the answers in the
					solution
					interviews. Eventually, we came up with this statement: "As a trusted partner for expats, our
					brand
					offers more than just documentation, legalization, and translation services. We understand the
					challenges and complexities of moving to a new country and provide personalized services to help
					expats feel welcome, safe, and connected in their new homes. From cultural orientation to
					networking
					events, we aim to create a supportive community that empowers expats to thrive in their new
					environment, no matter where they come from."
				</p>
				<h5>Validation</h5>
				<p>
					As a result of all the gathered interviews, we noticed that people we showed our website to were
					satisfied with the new value proposition. They understood the meaning behind it and were more
					willing to understand more about the services we were offering. In conclusion, we stayed with
					this
					value proposition as a final version.
				</p>
				<h3>CHANNELS</h3>
				<p> Soon after we started developing our Instagram page, we noticed we would need help developing
					another three platforms, and the content would get repetitive. That's why we asked in the solution
					interviews if people were okay with having Instagram and Facebook pages, and the answers were
					positive. They said they thought these were the main channels expats use to search for our services,
					so we used these two channels to advertise our website. As we have a website, we had to use these
					channels to promote it so people interested in getting to the website can find the information they
					need there.
				</p>
				<h5>Validation</h5>
				<p>
					We are now focusing mainly on Instagram and trying to expand our Facebook page, even though it is
					more challenging to reach people on Facebook nowadays. Surprisingly, with our Instagram page, our
					team achieved our marketing goals, and we are satisfied with the results as we got enough people on
					this channel. The plan is to make more people look into our website as it's finalized and ready to
					be used.
				</p>
				<h3>CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP</h3>
				<p>As we had the first interviews, we noticed people want our brand to interact more with them as we
					stand for connection with them. We wanted a long-lasting customer relationship, which improved after
					the solution interviews. The interviewed contestants mentioned that they would like to talk to our
					team in person whenever they have questions regarding documents when moving abroad. That's why we
					considered this and ensured we understood our customers' needs and, based on their questions,
					resolved any issues or concerns that may arise. At the same time, from the solution interviews, we
					concluded that people would like to receive the information in English as this is the most used and
					preferred language.
				</p>
				<h5>Validation</h5>
				<p>
					At the end of the project, we are happy with the outcome in terms of the customer relationship as we
					were able to reach many people from our Instagram page who were interested to find out more about
					our brand and suggest our services to their friends who will be moving soon to the Netherlands.
					Also, our whole brand is in English which is understandable for everyone, and we made sure to have a
					team and specialists who are English speakers, so it would be easier for expats to communicate and
					create a better relationship.
				</p>
				<h3>KEY RESOURCES</h3>
				<p>After the solution interviews, our team worked more on the key resources knowing they are an
					essential asset to our brand. Unfortunately, at that moment, we only had human resources as a
					possible key resource. Still, after the interviews, we had nice recommendations to expand the key
					resources more by allowing valuable and trustworthy document management software to speed up the
					processing and archiving of papers and guarantee their confidentiality and security. Also, we
					decided to hire someone who can translate specific documentation so our target audience doesn’t feel
					frustrated by translating it themselves.
				</p>
				<h5>Validation</h5>
				<p>
					Ideally, we want to expand our brand by creating a workspace where people can come to us and get
					their help in person. We still need to work on achieving this, but so far, the team we are having is
					enough, as we still don’t have as big an audience as we might need if we are willing to open an
					office.
