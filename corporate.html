					<p>Please provide a list of design elements alongside their justifications:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							A colour scheme (with HTML colour codes, which must be consistent with your final website)
							<em>&mdash; see the example below from the BUas brand book:</em>
							<ul class="list-unstyled">
								<li>
									<span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1"
										style="background-color: #084E2F ;"></span>
									#084E2F
									<em>The green evokes a feeling of abundance and is associated with refreshment and
										peace, rest and security.
									</em>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1"
										style="background-color: #EDA63A ;"></span>
									#EDA63A
									<em>The yellow, amber colour represent happiness, confidence, and optimism.</em>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1"
										style="background-color: #FFF2E5;"></span>
									#FFF2E5
									<em>Pink beige, it is not exactly, but similar to white colour. It represents a
										desire
										for comfort.;</em>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1"
										style="background-color: #0A2919;"></span>
									#0A2919
									<em>Dark green signifies the desire to always look for an opportunity to get outside
										into the woods or wilderness.</em>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>

						<hr />

						<li>Font choices</li>

						<ul>
							<li><span style="font-family: Futura Bold, sans-serif;">Futura Bold</span> – Use it in our
								logo, and also for headings on our website. Futura fonts have an appearance of
								efficiency and forwardness. When put in bold it just justifies this statement. </li>
							<li><span style="font-family: Open Sans, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Open
									Sans</span> - All of the other text is easy to read. It represents, open
								forms and a neutral, yet friendly appearance. This connects with what our brand stands
								for.</li>
						</ul>

						<hr />

						<li>User interface patterns (e.g. grids, carousels, menu organizations etc.)</li>

						<ul>
							<li>Thumbnail - The user needs to get an overview of multiple pictures without having to
								download each of the full size images.</li>
							<li>Grid - The user can see all images and text in a grid-like structure for readability and
								content
								minification.</li>
							<li>Modal menu - The user needs to take an action or cancel the menu overlay until he can
								continue interacting with the original page</li>
							<li>Home link - The user can go back to the start page of the website from anywhere by
								clicking the Expatify logo</li>
							<li>Navigation bar – It remains in the top right corner and is always hidden unless you
								press the tree bars, at which point it displays the menu (upon clicking the menu button
								a JavaScript function runs that alters the style of the menu to be “display: visible”
								instead of “hidden” and plays a transition animation from right to left) and allows you
								to select which page you want to visit. We chose to place the navigation bar in the top
								right corner because testing revealed that people naturally seek this feature on the
								right side of their screen, and because most people were holding their phones, it was
								easier for them to reach out and click the navigation bar.</li>

					<h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
					<h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
					<p> Our brand helps expats with all the documents that they need in order to start living their life
						without worrying. We had interviews with expats from different countries and ages, so we can get
						an
						insight into when and how they use social media platforms. The main channels they were using
						were
						Instagram & Facebook.
					</p>
					<p>Our Objectives: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Reach objective: By the 10th of April we aim to have an Instagram account with a follower
							count
							of 40 people and an average post/reel view of 140.</li>
						<li>
							Affective objective: We want the customer who reaches out to us to feel comforted by our
							service. Since the arrival to a new country can be insecure we provide some security.
						</li>
						<li>
							Responsive objective: We want our Instagram page to achieve a following of 40. We plan to
							hand
							out a survey where they will have the opportunity to sign up for a newsletter. With that, we
							aim
							to collect 15 email addresses.
						</li>

					</ul>
					<p></p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Based on the interviews that we did at the beginning of the project, with our target audience we
						got
						the information that they are using mostly Instagram & Facebook/ Facebook groups. Our objective
						goal
						was to reach out to 40 people to follow our Instagram and Facebook pages. On Instagram, we
						reached a
						total of 149 followers, and on Facebook, we have a total of 40 likes.</p>

					<h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
					<p>Even though from our interviews, we have gained information that a lot of expats are using
						Facebook,
						we managed to see that Instagram was way more successful for our campaign. The post that made
						the
						most impact with over 1600 views and around 100 likes was the first reel that we posted.
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>One major thing we have learned is that it is a good idea to have better communication
							between
							us in order to organise properly who is going to post what and at what time. That is when
							the
							content calendar comes in handy. One thing that we have learned was to create the content in
							advance so it can be easily accessible from everyone and be posted when it is scheduled.
						</li>
						<li>
							We realised that even though in our interviews it was stated that our target audience stated
							that they use Facebook, our Facebook account has not succeeded as much as our Instagram
							page. We
							also had technical problems when it comes to creating the Facebook page.
						</li>
						<li>
							We were positively surprised to see how posting our first reels turned out. We got a total
							of
							likes 109 and also around 1500 views.
						</li>
						<li>
							Based on our insights, we have reached almost 500 accounts with our reels, and 150 with our
							posts, and most of them are based on our followers when with the reels, most of them reached
							accounts that do not follow us yet.
						</li>
						<li>
							In order to have more success in our Facebook campaign, we believe that posting the same
							content
							as we did on Instagram would create a different impact on our insights.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
					<p>We would start with a clear overview of the content calendar, consisting of more detailed
						information
						about what the post is going to be. Since we have better insights now when our target audience
						is
						more active, we will make sure to post around those certain hours. </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Make a plan: The marketing team can ensure that everything is posted on time and that there
							is
							enough time for review and revision by creating content at least one week in advance. It
							also
							allows for the inclusion of current events or news that may be of interest to the brand or
							audience. </li>
						<li>
							Marketing efforts should be examined on a regular basis to determine what is and is not
							working.
							This means tracking metrics such as engagement and conversion rates, as well as soliciting
							audience feedback. Based on this data, the marketing strategy can be tweaked as needed to
							achieve the best results.
						</li>
						<li>
							Use multiple channels: It is critical to have a presence on multiple channels where your
							target
							audience is active on social media platforms. Each channel may necessitate a different type
							of
							content and messaging, so the approach must be tailored accordingly.
						</li>

					</ul>
					<p>Describe in detail your future recommendations if the campaign would be continued.</p>
					<p>Detail and describe clearly the process of what your would do differently based on you experience
						on
						this
						project related to the marketing assignment.</p>
					<h4 id="marketing-4" class="mt-4">Professionalism</h4>
					<p>Present and organize below all social media/online activities of the campaign. Context and
						material
						are
						according to the brand style, image, and vision. Images on the site are of high-quality,
						readable,
						and
						properly designed.</p>
