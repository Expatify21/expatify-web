					<h4 id="production-1" class="mt-2">Design Elements</h4>
					<p>Please provide a list of design elements alongside their justifications:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							A colour scheme (with HTML colour codes, which must be consistent with your final website)
							<em>&mdash; see the example below from the BUas brand book:</em>
							<ul class="list-unstyled">
								<li>
									<span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1"
										style="background-color: #084E2F ;"></span>
									#084E2F
									<em>The green evokes a feeling of abundance and is associated with refreshment and
										peace, rest and security.
									</em>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1"
										style="background-color: #EDA63A ;"></span>
									#EDA63A
									<em>The yellow, amber colour represent happiness, confidence, and optimism.</em>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1"
										style="background-color: #FFF2E5;"></span>
									#FFF2E5
									<em>Pink beige, it is not exactly, but similar to white colour. It represents a
										desire
										for comfort.;</em>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1"
										style="background-color: #0A2919;"></span>
									#0A2919
									<em>Dark green signifies the desire to always look for an opportunity to get outside
										into the woods or wilderness.</em>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>

						<hr />

						<li>Font choices</li>

						<ul>
							<li><span style="font-family: Futura Bold, sans-serif;">Futura Bold</span> – Use it in our
								logo, and also for headings on our website. Futura fonts have an appearance of
								efficiency and forwardness. When put in bold it just justifies this statement. </li>
							<li><span style="font-family: Open Sans, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Open
									Sans</span> - All of the other text is easy to read. It represents, open
								forms and a neutral, yet friendly appearance. This connects with what our brand stands
								for.</li>
						</ul>

						<hr />

						<li>User interface patterns (e.g. grids, carousels, menu organizations etc.)</li>

						<ul>
							<li>Cards - 7x - This was used throughout the website for a variety of purposes. We have
								used it as in order to get a better layaout. It can be found in the home page as well as
								the about us page. </li>
							<li>Carousel - 1x - We chose this because photos attract people more than text and drawings.
								This was a nice way to have an appealing element on the website while also displaying
								the other pages we have. Can be found at the about us page. </li>
							<li>Thumbnail - 2x - The user needs to get an overview of multiple pictures without having
								to
								download each of the full size images. Could be found on the corporate justification
								page. </li>
							<li>Grid - 2x - The user can see all images and text in a grid-like structure for
								readability and
								content
								minification. Can be found on home page, about us and corporate page. </li>
							<li>Modal menu - Can be found on every page - The user needs to take an action or cancel the
								menu overlay until he can
								continue interacting with the original page</li>
							<li>Home link - Can be found on every page - The user can go back to the start page of the
								website from anywhere by
								clicking the Expatify logo</li>
							<li>Navigation bar - Can be found on every page - It remains in the top right corner and is
								always hidden unless you
								press the tree bars, at which point it displays the menu (upon clicking the menu button
								a JavaScript function runs that alters the style of the menu to be “display: visible”
								instead of “hidden” and plays a transition animation from right to left) and allows you
								to select which page you want to visit. We chose to place the navigation bar in the top
								right corner because testing revealed that people naturally seek this feature on the
								right side of their screen, and because most people were holding their phones, it was
								easier for them to reach out and click the navigation bar.</li>
						</ul>
						<ul class="list-unstyled d-flex flex-wrap justify-content-center align-items-center">

						</ul>
						<hr />
						<li>The structure of the <strong>navigation and content</strong> (e.g. how content units are
							distributed across pages)
							<p>We chose multiple pages because they better divide different aspects. It can be
								overwhelming if everything is on one page; it's better to have separate pages for
								different things.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Home page: We begin with text welcoming them to the Netherlands, our logo, and
									product cards. We chose to put this first to emphasize what we want to do and what
									we can offer.</li>
								<li>About Us Page: Here we begin by introducing the brand more thoroughly, as this is
									what our visitors are looking for. We provide them with the vision and values, as
									well as contact information. Following that, a carousel appears, and we introduce
									the team at the bottom.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>All these elements must be justified by referring to the theory <strong>and/or
								vocabulary</strong> of
							design
							<ul>
								<li>
									Due to the design principle of alignment, we used a navigation bar menu and placed
									it in the top right corner. When people looked at our website, they instinctively
									looked for the menu in the upper left or upper right corner. In order to place our
									information on the home page and the about us page we used cards to put in one place
									the information for each value or post. We used carousels tool to showe the members
									of our team.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>

						<li>Please relate these elements to other units, for example:
							<ul>
								<li>How does website design fit the <strong>values and personality of the
										brand</strong>?
									<ul>
										<li>
											Our website's design perfectly represents our brand's values. As you can see
											from the headlines, we have bold headlines that represent security and
											stability, which can be considered security. Our goal is to unite and assist
											all expats at the start of their new adventure, so we chose green and amber
											yellow as colors that represent security, optimism, and dependability.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>How does website design fit the <strong>marketing and communication
										strategy</strong>?
									<ul>
										<li>
											Our marketing strategy relied on social media platforms such as Instagram
											and Facebook. According to the information we gathered from our interviews,
											these social networks are the most popular among our target audience. Posts
											on our social networks supplement those on our website because when one of
											our users sees a post and wants to learn more. Users can easily access the
											information on the website, and there is a search engine button to make
											their experience more convenient.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>How does website design help showcase the <strong>unique value proposal of the
										product</strong>?
									<ul>
										<li>
											Users can easily find the information they require thanks to our
											user-friendly website. We make it easy for users to access everything they
											need thanks to the patterning used to create the buttons, which is exactly
											what our brand aims to do, make it easy for our target group to start fresh.

						<li>Your testing <strong>goals</strong> &ndash; in other words, what you are trying to learn
							about
							your

							<p>Throughout our testing we had various goals in mind, let me list them over here for a
								quick overview.</p>

							<ul>
								<li>How easy it is to navigate on the website? </li>
								<li>How fast and easy can you find specific information? </li>
								<li>Do you understand what is our brand about? </li>
								<li>What would you change in the UI that would make it easier for you to find things?
								</li>
								<li>Would you be interested in such a service knowing the information provided on the

							</ul>

						</li>
						<br />
						<li>Your testing <strong>methods</strong>, which includes information about:
							<ul>
								<li>The test&rsquo;s <strong>participants</strong> (number, match with target audience,
									etc.)
									<ul>
										<li>“Expatify to me seems like a brand with goals that I support.

											I have lots of friends that could really use a service like this.

											I think that something that the brand could improve is reevaluate its main
											goals which are safety and support. Those are great values, but I feel like
											a better core value could be clarity, because I feel like uncertainty and
											confusion are the worst problems you face when you're moving into a new and
											scary situation. So, what I’m trying to say is that focus on the latter one
											among all the values. Otherwise, the website is clean and easy to use.”
											<br />
											Aiken – 26 years old - <b>ONLINE INTERVIEW</b>
										</li>
										<li>“Everything is very understandable; design is warm and inviting - that fits
											with companies’ values. I really like the chosen style and its continuity
											that follows through pages, social media profiles and posts. That also goes
											about visuals and images of the site that interacts by opening a link to
											social media. Tip - layout of website could be a bit more interesting as it
											follows horizontal linearity through all pages and lines between articles
											highlight that more.”
											<br />
											Eliza – 25 years old - <b>PERSONAL MEETING</b>
										</li>
										<li>“It looks great but sometimes I felt like it is more like a word document
											and not a website, that might just be the lack of pictures but that’s how I
											fell, otherwise easy to navigate and looks clean.”
											<br />
											Sam – 24 years old - <b>ONLINE INTERVIEW</b>
										</li>
										<li>
											“I think the design looks very good, I can understand everything that’s on
											the site, I can find things quickly. I wish I had had something like this
											when I moved here about a year ago. What I might add is that you should tone
											out the confusion and uncertainty part, that can really touch people and
											relate to them.”

								<li>The test&rsquo;s <strong>setting</strong> and <strong>protocol</strong> (which

									remotely,
									on campus, at
									home, etc.)
									<ul>
										<li>
											The test setting was very simple, we provided the participants with a laptop
											where we opened the main page of our website. This took place either online
											or from their home, we visited them and did it in person. We took notes of
											what they were saying and asked them to write a couple sentences of
											text-based feedback that are visible here below. They were asked to find a
											couple things such as our values, vision, and our main product.

							</ul>
						</li>
						<br />
						<li>Your testing <strong>results</strong>, which includes information about:
							<ul>
								<li>Positive and negative aspects of the UI/UX that have been identified, ranked by
									importance.
									<br />
									Positive:
									<ul>
										<li>The navigation is simple and straightforward, allowing users to find what
											they need quickly and easily. </li>
										<li>The interface is visually appealing, which enhances the user experience.
										</li>
										<li>The design is responsive, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes and
											devices while maintaining a consistent user experience. </li>
									</ul>
									Negative:
									<ul>
										<li>Because the font size is too small, some users may struggle to read the
											text. </li>
									</ul>
									<br />
									Overall, the positive feedback indicates a well-designed and user-friendly
									interface, while the negative feedback identifies some areas for improvement, such
									as font size.
								</li>
								<br />
								<li>Improvements that have been implemented on the final website (or that would be
									implemented if doing so
									would be too complex)
									<br />
									Concluding all the interviews we have conducted we changed our website for the
									better. Let’s go through these changes in bullet points ranked by the importance of
									them:
									<ul>
										<li>UI wise we have put in more pictures and made it more interactive to the
											user. </li>
										<li>We have moved our drop-down menu to the top right where you can access
											everything. </li>
										<li>We would change our value importance and tone out the uncertainty and
											confusion (didn’t change that because we would have to structurally redesign
											most of the content) </li>
										<li>We would add even more filling content apart from text, but we can’t do that
											yet since we have limited amount of content at the time, however with
											progress more of that would come making the website more User friendly.
										</li>
									</ul>

					<h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
					<h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2" style="text-align: center;">Context of campaign</h4>
					<p> At Expatify, we understand the challenges that come with trying to navigate foreign bureaucracy
						when relocating to the Netherlands. Our mission is to make moving to a new country an exciting
						adventure, not a stressful paperwork nightmare. We provide support to individuals that’s why our
						team consists of experts which are specialized in document legalization, authentication, and
						translation, ensuring a smooth transition for expats. Our goal is to simplify the process of
						moving to
						a new country and empower expats to enjoy their new lives to the fullest. Our campaign aims to
						raise awareness of our brand and showcase our expertise. We want to free expats from
						hopelessness and loneliness and give them the security and support they need.
					</p>

					<h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2" style="text-align: center;">Promotional activities</h4>
					<p> To promote our brand, we launched a campaign on Instagram and Facebook. Through the interviews
						we did, it quickly became clear that our target audience is very active on Instagram and uses
						Facebook, especially Facebook groups, to get information about moving abroad. That's the reason
						we chose these two channels.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our aim was to promote our services and highlight the benefits of using Expatify when moving to
						the
						Netherlands. We created engaging social media posts, including photos and videos, that showcase
						our expertise and the values we bring. Our focus was to highlight the complexity of foreign
						papers
						and how we simplify the process for our customers. With the help of informative and funny posts,
						we wanted to show our customers our ability to provide support to make sure they have every
						information they need.
					</p>
					<p>
						We tried different types of posts like reels, carousel posts, memes and stories to attract the
						attention of our target group and increase the reach. We even made a survey to generate a bigger
						response and get more insides of our target audience. The meme we made was fun to look at and
						easy to forward to your friends or people you know that deal with this type of struggles when
						moving abroad.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our promotional activities were designed to meet following objectives and provide a solid link
						to the
						objectives outlined in our communications and media plan. We believe that everyone deserves a
						smooth transition when moving to a new country, and we're here to make that a reality for our
						clients.
					</p>

					<h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2" style="text-align: center;">Our Objectives</h4>

					<p>After doing interviews with expats, we found out that many of them use Facebook. However, we
						learned throughout our campaign that Instagram was more successful. Our Instagram page has been
						more popular in terms of engagement and reach. We faced some technical issues while creating our
						Facebook page, which might be the reason why it did not perform well.</p>

					<h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4" style="text-align: center;">Learning Points</h4>
					<p>After doing interviews with expats, we found out that many of them use Facebook. However, we
						learned throughout our campaign that Instagram was more successful. Our Instagram page has been
						more popular in terms of engagement and reach. We faced some technical issues while creating our
						Facebook page, which might be the reason why it did not perform well.
					</p>
					<p>We realized that it's crucial to understand how our target audience thinks. We did this by
						finding out
						how they use different types of media by analyzing the insights we gained through Instagram and
						Facebook. For example when we created the timeline for the postings we decided on times around
						12 noon. Then, when we started actively posting on different times, we learned that our target
						audience is much more active in the afternoon from about 4pm than between 12pm - 3pm. After
						4pm, the likes were mostly 50+, whereas at the earlier times they were only about 35. Also our
						most
						seen reel was posted at 6pm, which strengthens this finding.
					</p>
					<p>The reel received over 1600 views and around 100 likes. The video showed in the beginning three
						people looking hopeless and stressed, struggeling in front of a desk with a lot of paperwork.
						Later
						you can see two people giving each other a high-five and smiling with the quote: “When In doubt
						-
						ask for help – Expatify”. This post showed our message in a good and relatable way and was very
						popular with our target audience. We also noticed that we were able to reach accounts that do
						not
						follow us yet, which is a great opportunity for us to expand our reach.
					</p>
					<p>In general we got more followers than we hoped for, with 149 instead of just 40 by April 10th.
						And
						based on our insights, we were able to reach average almost 997 accounts with our reels, and
						about
						115 with our regular posts. So on the average we did not get as many views on our posts as we
						wanted 115 instead of 140. We also did not get as many E-Mail addresses as we hoped, but we did
						get 5 which is a good start, and only 40 participants took part in the survey instead of the
						hoped-for
						50.
					</p>
					<p>We have also learned that it is a great help to actively share the account on the Instagram
						stories of
						our experts, as this increases the likelihood of reaching people who would need such a service.
						Following and refollowing potential interested people has increased our reach and follower count
						too. Stories with links and Instagram polls also gained a higher reach than other ones.
					</p>
					<p>Through Facebook, we've learned that it's much harder to build a large reach than we thought.
						Posts
						like memes are far better received there than the normal ones. We had a hard time generating
						followers and reaching the right people. Which is also the reason why we couldn't achieve our
						objectives.
					</p>
					<p>One of the most important things we learned from our social media campaign is the importance of
						communicating better between team members to ensure proper organization of tasks. That is when
						the content calendar comes in handy. One thing that we have learned was to create the content in
						advance so it can be easily accessible from everyone and be posted when it is scheduled.
					</p>

					<h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4" style="text-align: center;">Future Planning</h4>
					<p>In the future, we would focus more on reels on instagram, as we noticed that they generate more
						attention from our audience. We would also adjust the posting times to after 6pm, as there is
						more
						activity then. We would fill the stories with exciting polls and post funny photos that fit the
						topic, so
						that these are shared with friends and colleagues and therefore increase the reach even more.
						On Facebook we plan to post different content than we did on Instagram to see if we can get a
						better response. We would join Facebook groups that address similar topics and share links to
						our
						posts, so people click on it and build a community and reach. We have learned that reaching our
						audience on Instagram and Facebook works completely differently and we need to adapt our
						content better to the given platform. We are committed to improving our social media campaign to
						serve our audience better and achieve our goals. </p>
					<p>If the campaign would be continued in the future we would partner up with Influencers. Influencer
						marketing is a good way to reach new audiences and build brand awareness. We consider working
						with influencers who have a strong following among expats and using their platforms to promote
						the company's services.</p>
					<p>We would collaborate with popular expat social media personalities who have a strong following
						among expat communities. For instance, we would work with an expat blogger who frequently
						writes about the challenges of adjusting to life in a new country. They will share their
						positive
						experience of using Expafity's services in one of their posts or videos, highlighting the
						benefits of
						using the service for expats. The post will include a discount code, which will encourage their
						followers to try out the service for themselves. This will help us reach a wider audience and
						build
						trust with potential customers, while also providing valuable content to the influencer's
						followers</p>
					<p>A potential Influencer would be:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							@santanamatheus – Matheus Santana is a humorous influencer who shares his experiences
							living in the Netherlands. He‘s from Brazil and in his posts he often discusses Dutch
							culture
							and customs, including the legal system, and provides entertaining commentary on his
							experiences
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>As Expafity, we would also be offering incentives to new customers. We would consider offering
						discounts, free trials, or other special offers to incentivize people to try our services. For
						instance, we
						could offer a 50% discount on the first month's subscription to new customers. This would
						provide
						them with a chance to experience the benefits of our platform firsthand at a reduced cost. Such
						offers would encourage more people to try our service and increase conversion rates.</p>

					<h6>Content Explanation: Instagram & Facebook posts</h6>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/corporate/pro1.png" alt=""
								style="max-width: 200px;" /></span>
						<br />
						<br />
						On our first post we decided to share a "coming soon" photo on our Instagram account. It creates
						excitement and anticipation among the followers and it gave a sneak peek into what we're working
						on.
					</p>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/corporate/pro2.png" alt=""
								style="max-width: 200px;" /></span>
						<br />
						<br />
						Since our first post doesn't provide much information, it did not had a significant impact on
						our
						reach. That’s why we wanted to increase the engagement with our second post. We did that by
						posting a more informative post, that provides value to potential customers. We addressed a pain
						point that many expats face, offering a solution that could be appealing to them. We also used
						hashtags such as #expatlife and #internationalmoving.
					</p>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/corporate/pro3.png" alt=""
								style="max-width: 200px;" /></span>
						<span class="image left"><img src="images/corporate/pro3.1.png" alt=""
								style="max-width: 200px;" /></span>
						Our third and fourth posts were a call-to-action for our followers to participate in our survey
						to provide us with information and valuable insights. They showed that we care about your
						customers' needs and want to improve our services to better meet their needs. We used relevant
						hashtags like #expatsurvey and #feedbackwelcome which helped to increase our reach and attracted
						more followers who were interested in participating in surveys or giving feedback.
					</p>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/corporate/pro4.png" alt=""
								style="max-width: 200px;" /></span>
						<br />
						<br />
						<br />
						<br />
						<br />
						Our fifth post was a reel which got a very high reach. We used the video and caption to
						highlight
						the benefits of our services. We promoted our brand and made it clear to potential customers
						what
						we can offer them. We also used hashtags such as #expatlife and #internationalmoving.
					</p>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/corporate/pro5.png" alt=""
								style="max-width: 200px;" /></span>
						<br />
						<br />
						Our sixth post was again a call to action to follow our Facebook page. With this we wanted to
						expand our reach beyond just Instagram. We also added a link to our Facebook page which makes it
						easy for interested users to quickly access more information about our services. We encouraged
						followers to stay informed through our Facebook page as well.
					</p>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/corporate/pro6.png" alt=""
								style="max-width: 200px;" /></span>
						<br />
						<br />
						As seventh post we were informing our followers about the unique personal identification number
						system in the Netherlands called BSN (Burgerservicenummer). This post also serves as a reminder
						to
						our followers that we are here to help them if they need it. In addition to being informative,
						this
						post includes a fun fact, which can help to make the information more engaging and memorable for
						our followers.
					</p>

					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/corporate/pro7.png" alt=""
								style="max-width: 200px;" /></span>
						<br />
						<br />
						<br />
						As eighth post we shared a Reel in which we were using humor to convey the message that
						dealing with legal documents as an expat can be a difficult and time-consuming process. We as
						well positioned ourselves as a helpful resource for expats who need assistance with their legal
						documents. The use of a meme helped to make the post more engaging and relatable for our
						followers. Memes are more often shared and reposted, which helps to increase the reach of our
						post.

					</p>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/corporate/pro8.png" alt=""
								style="max-width: 200px;" /></span>
						<br />
						<br />
						<br />
						With the ninth post we were reaching out to our followers and encouraging them to share their
						most memorable experience from their first year of moving abroad. This is a great way to engage
						with our audience and create a sense of community among expats.
						<br />
						<br />
					</p>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/corporate/pro9.png" alt=""
								style="max-width: 200px;" /></span>
						<br />
						<br />
						With the tenth post is a again an informastional post. We are addressing a common issue that
						many expats face when living in the Netherlands: navigating the complex world of life insurance.
						The
						use of a picture of a family helped to create an emotional connection with our audience.
						<br />
						<br />
					</p>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/corporate/pro10.png" alt=""
								style="max-width: 200px;" /></span>
						<br />
						<br />
						The eleventh post is announcing the upcoming launch of our website and expressing our
						excitement about it. By sharing our excitement, we are showing our followers that we are
						committed to providing them with the best possible service and making their expat journey as
						smooth as possible.
					</p>
					<br />
					<br />
					<h4 style="text-align: center;">Target Group</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>19-27 year olds</li>
						<li>Expats living in the Netherlands</li>
						<li>Young working people</li>
						<li>All genders</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						According to the interviews we conducted, our target group primarily uses Instagram and
						Facebook,
						with Instagram serving as their primary source of information and entertainment. More of them
						use
						Instagram between tasks or before bed, and Facebook primarily when they have nothing else to do.
						When they spend time on social media, the majority of them are looking for entertainment or
						information. They use social networks according to their available time, which ranges from 2 to
						6
						hours per day.

					<h4 id="management-1" class="mt-2">Lean Canvas</h4>

					<p>Fill in at least 2 bullet points per building block and according to the rubrics.</p>

					<p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Convey information that is not by default communicated to new expats.</li>
						<li>Getting legal and personal documents (such as BSN number, bank account, phone number, etc.)
						</li>
						<li>Connecting people in the same situation, being a new expat in a foreign country. Making them
							feel comfortable in the new environment by being surrounded by other expats.</li>
						<li>By reading all the Dutch letters that the government sends you or by asking someone who was
							already here before and went through the same thing as you, the problem with that is they
							will only remember some of the small details. Some sites have information if you look for
							them, but they are also mainly in Dutch.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
					<ul>
						<li>On our Instagram, we post small tips and lesser-known facts about some Dutch legal
							procedures that everyone who comes here eventually must go through. Our leading service is
							that we take on the legal system instead of them, so they don’t have to worry about
							translating, understanding, and applying. Rather, everything will be in the same spot,
							personalized for their needs and with their consultation. This way, there will be no
							misunderstandings or overdue papers.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="fw-bold">Customer segments</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Expats between 18 and 24.</li>
						<li>Difficulties in understanding the system.</li>
						<li>The will to improve their stability.</li>
						<li>Working and studying expats.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>An Ideal customer is brand new to the country. Who needs legal papers such as BSN or a bank card.
						Since then, we can help them to acquire these items. They are financially stable and are
						motivated to understand and accomplish their legal stability in the country.</p>

					</ul>

					<p>Variable Costs:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Cost of raw materials ( paper, ink, stamps, envelopes) - around 100 euros per month
						</li>
						<li>Fees for legalizing documents (notarization)- The buyer pays notary fees, not the seller.
							Depending on the effort needed for the mortgage, costs range between 1,500 and 3,500 euros
							(<a

						</li>
						<li>Language translator- The average cost of a professional translator can range anywhere from
							$0.10 to $0.30 per word, depending on the language pair being translated, the quality of the
							translation, the turnaround time, and other factors. (<a

								here</a>)
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Total Costs:</p>
					<p>12,157,17 per month, excluding the notary and the translator
						Considering that our gross expenditure in a month is 12 157.17 euros. We break that down over a
						30-day month, adding to 12 157.17 / 30 = 405.239 euros a day. Now we assume that a unit would be
						produced in roughly thirty minutes and hour working days are 10 hours. We would accomplish two
						units every hour, meaning 10 x 2 = 20. So for 405.239 euros, we would get 20 units, so one unit
						is 405.239 / 20 = 20.26195 EUR.</p>

					<p class="fw-bold">Services/products</p>
					<ul>
						<li>State what your product and/or service is and how this contributes to your unique value

						<li>Clarify the fit between the product/service developed and the brand identity/brand image.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
					<p>Assumption #1:</p>
					<p>Our expats previously were feeling lonely and out of place, with the help of our service they
						will feel more freedom and security. If their feel of uncertainty has led them to the easier
						solution which is us therefore paid for our services</p>
					<p>Assumption #2:</p>
					<p>Navigating the Dutch bureaucracy and legal system can be time-consuming and frustrating,
						especially for those who are not familiar with the language or culture. Our company's services
						could save clients valuable time and energy by handling the document acquisition process on
						their behalf.</p>
