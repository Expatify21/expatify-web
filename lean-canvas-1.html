								CANVAS 1- AFTER THE FIRST INTERVIEWS
						</h2>
					</div>

				</header>
				<h5>CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION</h5>
				<p>At the beginning of our brand development, our target audience was expats mainly studying, and we
					focused on their needs and wants. However, after conducting the first interviews, our group noticed
					more expats were working, so we expanded our target group. With the first interviews, our
					segmentation was from 18 to 30, as the interviews we gathered were with people from 18 to 27. After
					the feedback we got from the interviews and the lecturers, there were changes we had to make to make
					a better target audience that is more concentrated on our brand idea.
				</p>
				<h5>VALUE PROPOSITION</h5>
				<p>The first value proposition we made for our brand wasn't as unique as we initially wanted, but we had
					to present something to our expats. That's why we came up with this one. - "Our company offers
					complete assistance with documentation, legalization, and translation services for expats relocating
					to a new nation. We strive to provide expats with more than just paperwork. We also connect them
					with other expats and services so they may feel at home. Thanks to our individualized approach,
					every expat receives the assistance they require to prosper in their new home and feel secure in
					their new community." After the interviews, we noticed the people we interviewed sought more
					emotional support. They wanted our brand to connect to them more emotionally, so we had to develop a
					unique idea for the value proposition to present a statement that communicates the unique value that
					our service will provide to our target group.
				</p>
				<h5>CHANNELS</h5>
				<p> As we wanted to expand our community as much as possible, we wanted to work with more channels in
					which we would be able to post more content to eventually reach more people and become more popular
					among expat who was struggling with their moving abroad. We wanted an Instagram and Facebook page, a
					LinkedIn account, and TikTok. We knew it would be hard, and we concluded that it would get
					overwhelming not only for our team but for the people we have as an audience. From 3 of the
					interviews we gathered, we found out our contestants would like more information and channels. As
					mentioned above, they will get overwhelmed and will not read or watch the content we will be making.
					So we had to think of other possibilities.
				</p>
				<h5>CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP</h5>
				<p>As we didn’t have a website yet and were starting to develop the brand, we didn’t have a unique
					customer relationship after the first interviews and had invested in creating one. However, we
					wanted a long-lasting relationship with activities and excellent customer service. We were aiming to
					make a connection to our target group and be able to understand their needs based on the feedback we
					gathered from the firsthand interviews. By making a solid customer relationship, we wanted to offer
					personalized advice and be able to take care of each person who reaches out, seeking help. Most
					importantly, we wanted to create a safe environment and make a connection with our expats so that
					they could feel welcomed in their new homes. Therefore, we started investing more in customer
					relationships as we didn’t do much initially.
				</p>
				<h5>KEY RESOURCES</h5>
				<p>We didn’t know precisely in which direction we had to go at that moment because our ideas for
					services were way too much, and we didn’t know what we needed regarding critical resources. At that
					moment, we only had the idea of having human resources, employees with expertise and knowledge who
					have handled documents from different nations and can offer our segmentation high-quality services.
					However, after the interviews, we noticed people were more open to those who could help them, and
					they wanted to have the opportunity to talk to them in person so they could better understand the
					professionals we were about to provide them. Some people also suggested having access to government
					agencies, especially regarding legalization. So we took their offerings into account, and we started
					working more on our critical resources as we saw we didn’t have mostly anything about that part of
					the lean canvas.
				</p>
				<h5>KEY ACTIVITIES</h5>
				<p>As mentioned above, we haven't had a working website yet, so we haven't thought of activities except
					for the ones we wanted to focus on at the beginning of the project, developing our services to help
					our customer segment, investing more time into marketing to expand the community, research more what
					are the emotional needs of the expats we interviewed so we could know how to improve our activities
					and be able to deliver the unique and trustworthy brand.
				</p>
				<h5>KEY PARTNERSHIPS</h5>
				<p>The only idea we had for key partnerships was to reach a company working with immigration laws, as
					they are a crucial partner for a paperwork and legalization service provider that caters to expats.
					These firms frequently request that their clients supply a variety of legal documents, including
					birth certificates, marriage certificates, and diplomas. By collaborating with these companies, our
					team could provide their services to the law firm's clients as a value-added service while the law
					firm concentrates on its primary legal services. After the interviews, we made a list of possible
					critical partners and the offers we got from them: language schools and international relocation
					companies. We had to find out if we would be able to work together with them to able to help expats.
