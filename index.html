								<p><a href="" target="_blank"><span class="image left"></span></a>
									The Burgerservicenummer, also known as the Citizen Service Number, is a unique
									identification number assigned to residents of the Netherlands. It's used to
									identify people in government systems and services like healthcare, taxes, and
									social security.
									This 9-digit number is
									used for a wide
									range of purposes, including healthcare, social security, taxes, education, and
									employment.
								</p>
								<p>
									The BSN number is nine digits long and is assigned to people at birth or upon their
									arrival in the Netherlands. It is used for administrative purposes and is required
									for many official transactions, such as opening a bank account, enrolling in
									healthcare, or applying for a job.
								</p>
								<p>
									ðŸ”’ It's important to keep your BSN safe and secure, as it is considered sensitive
									personal data.
									Make sure you only share it with trusted parties, such as government agencies,
									healthcare
									providers,
									and financial institutions.

								<img class="image featured" src="images/marketing/insurance.png" alt="" />
								<p><a href="" target="_blank"><span class="image left"></span></a>
									All residents are required to have basic health insurance, which covers essential
									healthcare such as visits to the general practitioner, hospital care, and
									prescription medications. You can select from a variety of insurance companies that
									provide basic health insurance. The government standardizes the coverage provided by
									all insurance companies, so the basic coverage is the same across all insurers.
									However, insurance costs can vary, so it is critical to compare policies and prices
									to find the best one for your needs.
								</p>
								<p>
									If you require medical attention, you can go to any healthcare provider in the
									Netherlands who is recognized by your insurance company. However, you may be
									required to pay a small amount toward the cost of your treatment, referred to as
									your "own risk" or "deductible." The government determines the amount of personal
									risk, which is â‚¬385 per year (as of 2023).
